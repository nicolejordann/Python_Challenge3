This my submission for the 3rd challenge of the course for the "Python" module.

To figure out how to format the decimal places of my percentages, I got my information from https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html

To learn how to use min/max functions I found this website very helpful https://realpython.com/python-min-and-max/
